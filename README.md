# Direct-Fallback
Direct-Fallback is a dynamic link library (DLL) designed to enhance your Minecraft gameplay by making Minecraft fallback to DirectX 11 (DX11) usage when injected into the game. Enjoy improved graphics quality, smoother rendering, and an overall more immersive gaming environment.
**This will not work if your PC is extremely low-end since Minecraft is already going to be using DX11.**

## How to Use
1. **Download the MCBE DLL Injector**: First, download [MCBE DLL Injector](https://github.com/ambiennt/MCBE-DLL-Injector).
2. **Install from Release**: To ensure you have the latest version, visit [Releases.](https://github.com/WhiteOnGitHub/Direct-Fallback/releases)
3. **Select the Direct-Fallback DLL**: Run the MCBE DLL Injector and Click on the "Select" button to choose the DLL
4. **Launch Minecraft**: Start your Minecraft game as you normally would (wait for the game to load), then press "Inject".
5. 
**If everything is done correctly your game should get reloaded and start using DX11.**
